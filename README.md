# trolled
This was made by Black Wolf.
Bit: https://github.com/kyle-bit/trolled/
Discord: Black Wolf#1990


It is a script that trolls players when they type "!stuck", "!unstuck" or "!troll". The player will need to rejoin while playing "You've been trolled" through their headsets :WHEZE:  I don't know why I made this but I think it's funny. If you get errors with it don't hesitate to contact me on discord so I can get it fixed.  Black Wolf#1990
